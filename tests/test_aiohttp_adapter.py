"""
Tests for AioHttpClientAdapter behavior.

Each test verifies how the adapter maps various upstream responses and errors
into the domain-level OGCProcessException responses. Expected outcomes:
- Non-JSON responses should be treated as invalid upstream content and map to
    an OGCProcessException with status 502 (Bad Gateway / Invalid Response).
- HTTP error status codes from the provider (e.g. 500) are mapped to
    OGCProcessException with the same status to allow upstream error reporting.
- Network timeouts map to OGCProcessException with status 504 (Gateway Timeout).

These mappings ensure the web adapter can reliably translate provider issues
into appropriate OGC-style error responses for API clients.
