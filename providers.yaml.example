# This is the configuration file for setting up simulation servers.
# The servers should provide an OGC processes api which will be retrieved
# on the fly to provide all existing processes via this api. Please provide the base url
# of the api, e.g. if there is an endpoint https://example.org/rest/api/processes
# then provide https://example.org/rest/api as url.
# This file should be considered as a secret.
