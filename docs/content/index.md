The Urban Model Platform is an Open Urban Platform to distribute and access (simulation) models for Urban Digital Twins. It builds on the [OGC API Processes](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-062r2/18-062r2.html) open standard and was developed by the City Science Lab at HafenCity University Hamburg and the Agency for Geoinformation and Suveying in the context of the [Connected Urban Twins](https://www.connectedurbantwins.de/) project.
